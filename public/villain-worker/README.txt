VILLAIN COMIC READER WORKER BUNDLE

This file serves as a placeholder for the expected Villain Comic Reader worker bundle.

INSTRUCTIONS:
1. Download the worker-bundle.js file from the libarchivejs package
   - You can find it in the node_modules/libarchive.js/dist/ directory after installing
2. Copy the worker-bundle.js file to this directory (/public/villain-worker/)
3. Make sure the file is correctly named: worker-bundle.js

This worker file is required for the Villain comic reader component to work properly.
Without this file, the comic reader will not be able to extract and display comics.

Note: For direct comic reading functionality in the future, this worker file must be 
properly installed in the public directory.
